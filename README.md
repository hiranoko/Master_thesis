# Abstract  

KEK-PF is a 2.5 GeV synchrotron radiation facility. In recent years, the injection efficiency using conventional pulsed septum and kicker magnets has decreased. The main cause of this problem seems to be the change of the injection parameters due to the accumulation of the errors including the effect of the earthquake on March 11, 2011. For the improvement of the injection efficiency, the precise and detailed parameters of the beam injection under present configuration are essential. In this paper, we show the beam based measurement, the simulation and the beam based optimization results for the PF ring injection system.
